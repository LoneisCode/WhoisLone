                        <h3>Hi, Nice to meet you!</h3>
                        <p class = "bio-text"> <span class="startEmojis">&#128220</span>My full name is Kniledge Johns, 
                            but typically my friends call me Lone so feel free to do so as well! I started coding while in college
                            and had no prior exprience before that! In the picture to the right you can see I
                            played rugby in college, that also was with no prior exprience as well. If there was
                            was one thing I considered myself to be: "I'm a stickler for starting at ground zero."
                            I love to start with no exprience and grow by doing it hands-on.
                        </p>
                        <p class="bio-text"><span class="startEmojis">&#127945</span>Now to explain how did I get
                        involved with rugby, like any college freshman you get bored and try things! I got
                        got contacted by the team before I even stepped a foot on campus, a few messages back
                        and forward and I finally attend a practice with no cleats... 
                        </p>

                        <p class ="bio-text">
                        so i ran bare foot the whole practice and towards the end  we scrimaged 
                        after me just learning the basics. I got the ball and ran faster than if my mom
                        was behind and I just got caught digging in her pot.

            <p>This project is just all about me and my leap into web development as a whole. 
                This site is the first sit I commited my time to with a clear head!
                I want to put my knowledge to use instead of saying: "Yea I have it..." . &#128282
